## **How to run it?**

Firstly you need to have Python 3.10.x installed, the current version of game runs on `python 3.10.5`.
<br>
Then you want to have the virtualenv, once you have Python installed you can run: `pip install virtualenv`.
<br>
When you have everything setted up you can run this command to activate your virtual environment: `source env/bin/activate`.
<br>
So here we are going to install game requirements by just typing this command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
<br>
Finally, you can run the game by running: `python main.pyc`.
